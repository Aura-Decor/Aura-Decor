# AuraDecor

AuraDecor is a comprehensive furniture management system with a modern web API backend built on ASP.NET Core 8.0. The application allows users to browse furniture items, manage their shopping cart, and place orders, while administrators can manage inventory, users, and special offers.

## Project Architecture

The solution follows the Clean Architecture pattern with separate layers for clear separation of concerns:

- **AuraDecor.APIs**: API controllers and presentation layer
- **AuraDecor.Core**: Domain entities, interfaces, and business rules
- **AuraDecor.Repository**: Data access and Entity Framework Core implementation
- **AuraDecor.Services**: Business logic implementation

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 8.0**: Backend framework
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for database operations
- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: Authentication and authorization
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication
- **Google Authentication**: External authentication provider
- **Swagger/Scalar**: API documentation
- **AutoMapper**: Object mapping

## Features

- User authentication and authorization with role-based access control
- Comprehensive furniture catalog with search and filtering
- Shopping cart functionality
- Special offers and discounts
- User profile and address management
- Admin panel for user management and inventory control
